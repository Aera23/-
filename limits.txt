While I hope to get as much uptime as possible, and minimise the risk of data loss / spread of internal data, nothing can be guaranteed.
Here is a short list of potential risks affecting the hosted site (but probably not Github)

Possible risks:
- Hosting laptop becomes unreachable due to internal or external factors (ufw error, network outage)
- Hosting laptop fails, whether whole or part (RAM/CPU/CPU fan/SD card/Live USB)
- Data loss due to config error (like losing messages, stale messages showing, etc)
- Data loss due to failed SD card (will happen eventually, backups may be out of date too)
- Equipment moving to storage (has happened!)
- Hosting building/contents becoming unusable (seems unlikely)
- Other risks may exist, I am not the universe

Please have backups of your own content / etc (even personal machine, unless you don't mind losing the data not backed up)
