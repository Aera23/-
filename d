This file will be updated to reflect downtime. Latest entries at the bottom.
Yes, GitHub is about code, but since they are reliable, I use them for NODs (Notices of Downtime)

on 27/09/2023, there was downtime due to machine being moved and battery coming loose
on 15/09/2023, there was roughly 8 mins of downtime due to wifi switched off when...
               trying to turn oven breaker off / mobile backup
on 18/09/2023, there was about 1 min downtime while Tor updated, restarted, and got back online.
               DDoS mitigation is also set, just in case.
on 21/10/2023, the chat went PHP 500 coz I misplaced some brackets and didn't test immediately after editing
on 23/10/2023, the wifi disconnected for 1 min due to breaker tripping, ending 8 days of router uptime
               Worse, the onionsite went offline for 1 hour, returning with degraded performance for 8 hours!
on 29/10/2023, the onion site somehow became unreachable, Tor was restarted and it fixed it (maybe 2 hours)  
               Records: 40 days since reboot, router is 15 days :)
on 05/11/2023, there was a few mins of chat downtime due to pcntl_alarm(5) being too powerful for my chat script   
on 08/11/2023, 12m downtime, the machine needed restart due to half-crash when accessing file properties :|
on 12/11/2023, 14m downtime, a semi-planned restart to protect against hours of downtime after USB disconnect
               also wifi was red (errored) briefly, idk why (note: usb is still healthy)
on 13/11/2023, I used ufw, it had an error, and it made my site unreachable for 8 hours (fixed in person)
on 15/11/2023, the router restarted, I only knew thru the config panel
