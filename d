This file will be updated to reflect downtime.
Yes, GitHub is about code, but since they seem pretty reliable, I will use them for NODs (Notices of Downtime)

on 27/09/2023, there was downtime due to machine being moved and battery coming loose
on 15/09/2023, there was roughly 8 mins of downtime due to wifi switched off when...
              trying to turn oven breaker off / mobile backup
on 18/09/2023, there was about 1 min downtime while Tor updated, restarted, and got back online.
               DDoS mitigation is also set, just in case.
on 21/10/2023, the chat went PHP 500 coz I misplaced some brackets and didn't test immediately after editing
on 23/10/2023, the wifi disconnected for 1 min due to breaker tripping, ending 8 days of router uptime
                 
Last updated: 23/10/2023. This file only reports known downtime, and I made it to 27.5 days since reboot:)
