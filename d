This file should be updated to reflect downtime.
Yes, GitHub is about code, but since they seem pretty reliable, I will use them for NODs (Notices of Downtime)

on 27/09/2023, there was downtime due to machine being moved and battery coming loose
on 15/09/2023, there was roughly 8 mins of downtime due to wifi switched off when...
              trying to turn oven breaker off / mobile backup
on 18/09/2023, there was about 1 min downtime while Tor updated, restarted, and got back online.
               DDoS mitigation is also set, just in case.
Last updated: 18/10/2023. This file only reports known downtime, and I made it to 21 days since reboot:)
